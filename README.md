##### Boilerplate

There are multiple ways, you can setup your node as well as react application.

1. You can use a this boilerplate(https://github.com/AltCampus/react-node-boilerplate) for creating full stack applications.

It has both node and react app running on same port. Setup for redux is also there.

OR

2. you can create 2 seperate applications i.e. one express server for serving APIs and another react application using create-react-app. Here, both applications will run on separate ports. you need to setup redux with react app on your own. 


##### Bonus
Deploy above full stack application on digitalocean/AWS, if possible and provide the website url for review.  

##### Note
There is no assignment repository provided for this project so create your own repository or use the boierplate accordingly.
